        <p>The Minnesota Ultimate Disc Invitational is always our first real taste of intra-regional competition during the club season. However, 2015 almost didn’t happen - heavy storms overnight caused the owner of the fields to shut them down, leaving the first ever sanctioned MUDI event to be without fields. After creative problem solving led largely by Drag n’ Thrust’s Dave Klink and Josh “Shwa” Hemmesch, local high school fields were procured and the games were ready to begin. With the heat index anticipated to be well over 100 degrees, the competition was sure to be hot.</p>

<h3>Day 1: Pool Play</h3>

<h4>Madison Boomtown Pandas</h4>

<p>After the chaos of almost cancelling the tournament, our focus was to play the whole game mentally strong. Our hopes of brunch and the beach were quickly dashed. However we wouldn’t let that affect us. The games started evenly with each team holding and Boomtown showing they were ready to dance. After a quick timeout called by Bird, we roll the next 4 and take half 7-3. And we wouldn’t stop there.  Electric play from Brian “Edge” Edgerton and the breaks of lefty Adam “Trauty” Trautman surged the team to a 13-5 win. With a spirited game coming to a close, we overcame the difficult start to the day and were excited to play.</p>

<h4>Minneapolis Coalition</h4>

<p>Game 2 started in a similar fashion to the first, and again we went on a small run to close out the half 7-4. Our focus in the second half was to do something that Bird had a historically tough time doing: closing out games.  he intensity was high as the anger at our missed opportunity for brunch fueled us to another 13-5 win. These two large margin victories were important in building our confidence and friendships.</p>

<h4>Minneapolis Millers</h4>

<p>The final game of the day proved the most mentally tough obstacle of the day. Emotions ran high on both sides as we prepared to play against many former Bird players. We were able to use that emotion to push ourselves to take half 7-4 capitalized by a beautiful huck from Pat Kunkel to a layout catch by Beret Amundson. Bird’s history of not being able to close out games came back to haunt us in the second half as the Millers came back and broke for 4 consecutive times for the lead. With the wind knocked out of us, we lost the game 10-13. </p>

<p>Knowing we had still advanced to championship bracket for Sunday, we did not dwell on the feelings of confusion and frustration after the game. Instead, we did what Bird does: get weird. Finding a local Olive Garden, we were able to drown our sorrows in the unlimited breadstick baskets of Olive Garden. This quickly became a competitive game led my Michael Ruble, the breadstick eating contest started as an individual competition of gluttony. But, as luck would have it, turned into a team bonding experience in an attempt to reach triple digits. In the end Pat Kunkel came away the individual winner, grossly consuming 11 breadsticks and contributing the most to the 103 total breadsticks consumed by the 17 Bird members present. A strong showing indeed and a great way to end pool play Saturday.</p>

<h3>Day 2: The ‘Ship</h3>

<h4>Quarterfinals - Madison Mad Udderburn</h4>

<p>Day 2 started with hunger. Hunger to erase that pool play loss. Hunger to prove the 4th seed we received was wrong. And boy did we eat. Ruble got the meal started with a huck to Beret for an upwind break which was quickly followed by 3 more for a fast 4-0 lead. They got a few back but we took half 7-3 and gobbled up the first three out of half sparked by Bryan “Bvon” Vohnoutka hitting a striking Ryan Oto for a rare score. Uddernburn would score more on some pretty hucks but could not erase our early lead. We closed the game in style, punctuated with a slick upwind flick from Edge. On to the semis against a familiar opponent.</p>

<h4>Semifinals – Minneapolis Drag’n Thrust</h4>

<p>Not winning our pool on Saturday came back to bite us now. Playing the reigning world champs in the semis wasn’t the most ideal situation we could have put ourselves into. Nonetheless, playing Drag’n always seems to bring out the best in us. We started the game on defense and Drag’n’s consistent offense held, showing their world-renowned consistency and athleticism. Next, it was our turn: Oto set the theme for our o-line in that game - high release lefties for scores, going over the top with a lefty scoober to Bvon.  After another hold by Drag’n, Gordy got his lefty in for the game. Shortly after, we earned the first break of the game. Drag’n again showing why they are such a dominant program, earned it back with patience and fierce play. The back and forth half ended on an amazing individual effort from Andrew “Razor” Kelley, earning bookends and giving Bird the break to lead 7-6.  </p>

<p>The second half started for us on offense we held, and never looked back. Drag’n made their comeback like we knew they would to tie it at 11 but we held on a tough upwind lefty from Dave. On game point, and uncharacteristic miscue from Drag’n left us near our own endzone and an opportunity to break for the win. Bvon showing how dominant he is in the air, sky’d everybody on a bail out high release prayer for the win. This was by far the most intense, exciting, and challenging game Bird has played all year. We are so fortunate to have a team like Drag’n in our section that always makes us play at a high level, sentiments that were echoed in the post-game spirit circle. If people didn’t think Minneapolis was a deep mixed community, perhaps they’ll believe it now. We will be seeing them at least one more time this season in the sanctioned showcase game at the Youth Club Championships in Blaine on August 7th.  On to the finals.</p>

<h4>Finals – Minneapolis Millers</h4>

<p>A rematch of the last game yesterday had us hungry for revenge. Unfortunately, the game against Drag’n had drained us of what intensity and fire we had left. The finals were almost a flip-flop of Saturday’s pool play. The Millers, after finishing off Des Moines Metro earlier in the round, came ready to play. Displaying his dominance throughout the first half Mark Pisansky led the Millers to a 4-0 lead and ultimately the Millers would take half 7-2. Bird needed some adjustments. It felt like the mental game wasn’t there and it needed to be. We needed to prove it to ourselves that we could play this game, the same way we had done with Drag’n.  </p>

<p>Revitalized with purpose, the second half featured a trait that teams such as Ellipsis, and the Polar Bears Rawr! had commented on at the U.S. Open: our resilience. Instead of rolling over, our sidelines took over the game, giving our players the energy to simply outrun the Millers in the second half with spectacular defensive efforts from Emma Peaslee and Jill Merkle. While we were unable to recover from our lack-luster showing in the first half, losing 10-13, we ended the game with our classic B-I-R-D cheer, excited about our efforts and play in that half. Despite the loss, the faces and attitudes of our teammates shined with smiles and love for one another. We proved that we could play for each other, no matter the circumstance or the opponent and it felt amazing. </p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Lots to take away from this weekend. A win over Drag’n shows we can compete and win at the highest level. A second place finish left us wanting more and excited to hit the gym, the practice field, and the treadmills. Moments of what we can be crystallized for us at this tournament and we will continue to strive to make our weirdness, resilience, and athleticism our every point style. </p>

<p>One weekend off before our next high level competition. See you in Aurora for the Pro-Elite Challenge.</p>
