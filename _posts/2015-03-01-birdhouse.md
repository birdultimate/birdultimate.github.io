For this upcoming season I’ve decided to try and tell the story of Bird’s becoming a team. Like much of the ultimate community, I want to understand the process; what went well and what didn’t. Unlike many of the types of sports writing that exists within the community of ultimate frisbee, I am going to attempt to do this in a more philosophical and theoretical way.

Why, many readers may ask, would you not stick to strategy or the concreteness of a ‘How-to’ guide?

The answer is straight-forward, but not simple: ultimate teams are about the interactions (relationships, tensions, communications) between people. Fundamentally this sport and its longevity and success reside within us, not outside of us. As such, an exploration into our existence and becoming as people merits a fresh take on the typical ultimate “here’s how my team succeeded or failed” exposé.

There are two reasons why I want to take up this project.

First, this is for my team. I want them to know how I feel and what I see the challenges and potential of our amazing and dynamic group of people.

Second, this is for people and teams considering reforming or attempting to commit to mantras of democracy, equality, or openness. These are incredibly complex subjects that make up the fabric of modern societies - thus they deserve more intentional thought and care. 

I’ve tried my best to write about this stuff accessibly. I’d like to thank my teammates in advance for putting up with me - it has given me a great sounding board for my ideas. On to the show!
