After much deliberation we have finalized our tournament schedule for the 2015 season. It is a blend of opportunities for growth and competition at the highest levels. The aim of this schedule is coming together as a team to learn, compete, challenge ourselves, and have a ton of fun. We are all really excited about this schedule and to begin playing with each other this summer!
