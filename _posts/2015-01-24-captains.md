We are pleased to announce returning players, Nihal Bahkta, Jill Merkle, and Katherine Zimmermann, as the captains of Bird Ultimate for the 2015 season.  We want to thank Andrew Kelley, Tobie Miller and Dan Schmit for doing an excellent job last year and hope we can work to improve and build on their successes in the 2014 season.
