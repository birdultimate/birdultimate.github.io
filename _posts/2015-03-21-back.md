Bird is back for the 2015 season.

After a 4th place finish at Regionals in 2014, Bird will compete as a Select Flight team out of the North Central in this year's USAU Triple Crown Tour.

We are pleased to announce returning players, Nihal Bahkta, #33, Jill Merkle (The Sauce) #69 Jill I dunno what you're actual number is, and Katherine Zimmermann (KZ) #14 as the captains of Bird Ultimate for the 2015 season.  We want to thank Andrew Kelley, Tobie Miller and Dan Schmit for doing an excellent job last year and hope we can work to improve and build on their successes in the 2014 season.

Keep an eye out for open pickup and tryout date announcements coming soon.
