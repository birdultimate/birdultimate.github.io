We are over-the-moon about our third consecutive invite to Colorado Cup, the Triple Crown Tour's Pro-Elite Challenge! We've had a terrific time in the beautiful Denver area in years past, and we love this opportunity to show that we can hang with the best.

We're also looking forward to the Select Flight Invite in Indiana in August. It's the perfect time in the season to get out of town and rack up some W's.

And we could never forget MUDI, a fun weekend in our own backyard. We hope the popularity of the sanctioned portion of the tournament will continue to grow, and we hereby offer up our couches to out-of-town teams who'd like to make the trip.
