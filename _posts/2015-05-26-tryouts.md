We've wrapped up our first combined open tryouts with [Drag'n Thrust](http://www.dragnthrust.com/), and invitations to closed tryouts have been sent.  Thanks so much to everyone who came out for one or more of our open tryouts and to Drag'n for a great collaboration.   If you received an email invite, we hope to see you at our closed tryouts!

If not, we really appreciate you coming out and helping to make the first ever combined tryout such a resounding success.  There was a ton of talent, and the captains will have even more tough decisions ahead of them.  We hope to see you next year!
