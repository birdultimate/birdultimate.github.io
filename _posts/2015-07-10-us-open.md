Not many people know much about Bird, other than they are from the same region as Drag n’ Thrust and CLX. This year more than ever, Bird challenged itself to solidify its identity with 13 rookies and play great ultimate. These were the focuses going into the US Open.

<h3>Day 1</h3>
<h4>Boston Wildcard</h4>

The game started with high energy fueled by the debut of our new, crisp, white jerseys. Wildcard got a few breaks early and never relinquished them. Led by #37 Matthew Heath and a strong deep game Wildcard took a lead into half. We got a few breaks back in the second half but never got closer than 10-7. The final score read 15-9 in what was a letdown of a score but it showed that we wouldn’t be a pushover whatsoever.

<h4>Minneapolis Drag’n Thrust</h4>

Game 2 pitted us against familiar frenemy and defending World Champs, Drag’n Thrust. They had just come off an intense double game point win against PBR. We came out firing and eventually led for a short while off some hot defense led by our captains Jill and Nihal. However, Drag’n’s experience showed and they rattled off three in a row to take half 5-8. In the end, a capped game ended 14-9. Day one ended without a win but we were still optimistic putting up 9 each to two National and World Semi-finalists.

<h2>Day 2</h3>
<h4>San Francisco American BBQ</h4>

Day 2 started with a game we knew would be a battle. A back and forth game dominated by quick handler movement on both sides and we found ourselves down 11-9 in a game to 13. After a timeout Bird dug deep and finished strong punctuated with a huge layout D by rookie Emily Fujii. Bird came out on top 13-12 for our first win of the tournament.

<h4>San Francisco Polar Bears</h4>

Coming off a close win, Bird had a bye before the next game. The intensity had worn off. A first half peppered by enormous skies by Bryan ‘Bvon’ Vohnoutka was simply not enough for Bird to hang with the elite Bears as they took half 2-8. It would have been easy to pack it in and give up on this game, but we were determined not to roll over. Energized with the chants of “Body Sushi” we showed we can adjust our game plan to our opponent and did much better in the second half but still fell 7-15, and with it, our slim hopes of reaching the semis were gone.

<h4>Melbourne Ellipsis </h4>

Our next game was against the surprise of the tournament, and eventual champion, Ellipsis. Having no idea what to expect from the Aussies combined with knowing they had not lost yet came around to haunt us. Again we looked slow as the quick movement and perfect, in stride, deep shots saw Melbourne take half 2-8 again. The second half was very similar to the previous game against PBR where we did better but the final ended 7-15 to the future champs. One positive we were able to take away was we could adjust, come back, and stick around against elite teams.

<h3>Day 3</h3>
<h4>Asheville Cahoots</h4>
This was it. Our last chance to make a statement and put another W on our record. In an all birds matchup (Cahoots Hooters), it was the most evenly matched of the tournament. A similar game to ABBQ on day 2 saw both teams take leads with breaks only to give them back later. We again found ourselves behind with soft cap on. With the score sitting 11-10 and a game to 12, two rookies looked poised to put the game away. Joe Nelson threw a beautiful huck to a streaking Steve Alexander who(m) bobbled it in the end zone and on the second attempt landed on his shoulder and broke his collarbone. Cahoots went on to force another double game point. The O line took care of business making it look easy and sealed the victory for our second win of the tournament. We finished 9th place and broke seed by one spot.
