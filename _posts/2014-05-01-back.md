Bird is back for the 2014 season.

After a 3rd place finish at Regionals in 2013, Bird will compete as the Top Select Flight team out of the North Central in this year's USAU Triple Crown Tour. We're looking to elevate our game and compete at an even higher level in 2014.

This year's Bird squad will be captained by Andrew Kelley, Tobie Miller, and Dan Schmit. We have a strong core of players returning, and will be hosting tryouts for the first time this year in hopes of attracting some fresh talent to the flock.  

Keep an eye out for tryout announcements coming soon.
